# Swimlane

The automation included is using the Chrome webdriver and assumes that you have Chrome or Chromium already installed. Node.js will also need to be installed to run npm commands in terminal/command prompt.

For Windows:
>	1. Open up Automation folder
>	2. Double-click windows-setup.bat
>	3. Open Command Prompt to nightwatch folder
>	4. npm install
>	5. npm run swimlane


For Linux:
>	In Terminal:
>	1. cd Swimlane/Automation
>	2. sudo bash linux-setup.sh
>	3. cd nightwatch
